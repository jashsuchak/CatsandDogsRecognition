# CatsandDogsRecognition

In this project, we aimed to develop a machine learning solution to accurately classify images of cats and dogs. We collected a comprehensive dataset containing labeled images of both cats and dogs and preprocessed it for training.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed and trained using TensorFlow to learn distinguishing features. The model was optimized and validated, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.6% in classifying the images.
